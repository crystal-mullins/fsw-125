            In this course you learned how to create servers. Thinking about your Capstone project and other real-world scenarios, explain the importance of servers.

            <p class="a-one">
                Answer: Without a server the interntet would not exist! That makes the server the first and most important part of the internet.

            Learning how to connect the Frontend (the website the User interacts with) to the Database (where the information is stored) with a Server is critical to becoming a Fullstack Engineer. Now that you’ve seen this critical piece of the Fullstack puzzle, what was hard, difficult, or surprising to you about Server Development, and why?

            <p class="a-two">
                Endpoints were hard because you had to make sure everything matched your query. Getting then to work was hard when it looked like a fairly simple task. 
            </p>

        <li class="q-three">
            Some developers like to focus strictly on Frontend dev, others on Backend dev; and there are those that like to work on the entire Fullstack. Thus far on your journey through this Bryan University Web Development program, you’ve gained quite a bit of experience on the Frontend. Now that you have gained some experience with Backend Development, do you like developing Servers more than creating React apps and working on the Frontend? Don’t worry, you have more time to consider your options, but depending on your objectives and career paths, it’s good to know there are many options available to you, and wise to start considering what it is that you enjoy doing. Discuss your thoughts on this topic.

            <p class="a-three">
                Answer: I prefer to build the front end because it allows me to be creative. I feel it is important for me to know full stack development so that I can fix any website issue and supervise the maintiance of the backend of the site I plan to biuld.
